# UE5 Multiplayer Application Security Project

## Objective
This project demonstrates a security analysis and hardening of a multiplayer Unreal Engine 5 C++ application.

The goal is to approach Unreal Engine as a real-world C++ client/server software and apply application security principles:
- threat modeling
- vulnerability identification
- controlled exploitation
- secure coding and hardening

## Context
Unreal Engine is used here as a complex C++ application similar to real enterprise software.

This project is not a game showcase.
It is a security-focused technical study.

## Security Scope
- Client/Server trust issues
- Network input validation
- Server-side authority
- Secure coding in C++
- Logging and abuse detection

## Target Role
Junior Application Security Engineer / Software Security Engineer
